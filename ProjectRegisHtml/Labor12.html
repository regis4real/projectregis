	<p>His last labour and undoubtedly the riskiest. Eurystheus was so frustrated that Heracles was completing all the tasks that he had given him that he imposed one he believed to be impossible: Heracles had to go down into the underworld of Hades and capture the ferocious <em>three-headed</em> dog <b>Cerberus</b> who guarded the gates. He used the souls to help convince Hades to hand over the dog. He agreed to give him the dog if he used no weapons to obtain him. Though its barbed tail posed a problem, he put it to sleep by squeezing the middle head until the other heads turned blue. </p>
		<p>Heracles succeeded and took the creature back to Mycenae, causing Eurystheus to be fearful of the power and strength of this hero.</p>
