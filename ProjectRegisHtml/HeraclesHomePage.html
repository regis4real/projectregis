    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p><b>Heracles</b> was a <em>demigod</em> born of <b>Zeus</b>; the king of the gods and Alcmene; a Theban princess. He is known in Rome and the modern West as <b>Hercules</b></p>
    <p>Named Heracles (glory of <b>Hera</b>) in an attempt to please her, the queen of the gods was still enraged at her husband’s promiscuity and so sent two snakes to kill the baby Heracles in his cradle at 8 months old. However, she was surprised when the baby demigod squeezed both snakes to death in a <em>godly grip</em>.</p>
    <p>Later in Thebes, Heracles married King Creon’s daughter Megara and had children. However, in a fit of madness induced by Hera, Heracles killed his children and Megara.</p>
    <p>After his madness had been cured with hellebore by Antikyreus, the founder of Antikyra, he realized what he had done and fled to the Oracle of Delphi. Unbeknownst to him, the Oracle was guided by Hera. He was directed to serve King Eurystheus for ten years and perform any task Eurystheus required of him. </p>
       <p> Eurystheus decided to give Heracles ten labours, but after completing them, Heracles was cheated by Eurystheus when he added two more, resulting in the <em>Twelve Labors of Heracles</em>.If he succeeded, he would be purified of his sin and, as myth says, he would become a god, and be granted immortality.</p>

      </ol>
<p>Despite the difficulty, Heracles accomplished these tasks, but Eurystheus in the end did not accept the success the hero had with two of the labours: the cleansing of the Augean stables, because Heracles was going to accept pay for the labour; and the killing of the Lernaean Hydra, as Heracles' nephew, Iolaus, had helped him burn the stumps of the multiplying heads.</p>

<p>Eurystheus set <b>two</b> more tasks, fetching the Golden Apples of the Hesperides and capturing Cerberus. In the end, with ease, the hero successfully performed each added task, bringing the total number of labours up to twelve.</p>
