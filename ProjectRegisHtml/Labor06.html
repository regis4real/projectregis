<p>These aggressive <em>man-eating</em> birds were terrorizing a forest near Lake Stymphalia in northern Arcadia.</p>
<p> Heracles shot them with his arrows but the arrows bounced off their feathers, for they were made of brass. <b>Athena</b> then appeared and handed him a rattle. When he shook the rattle, the birds flew in the air. Heracles shot and killed scores of them, because their under sides were not covered in brass.</p> 
<p>He brought the dead birds back as proof of his success to Eurystheus.</p>
