<p>Heracles defeated a lion that was attacking the city of Nemea with his bare hands. It had a skin that was <em>arrow-proof</em>. Its cave had two entrances, so he closed the bigger entrance and went in through the smaller one and strangled the lion to death. </p> 
<p>After he succeeded, he used the lion's claw to skin it and then he wore the skin as a cloak to demonstrate his power over the opponent he had defeated.</p>
