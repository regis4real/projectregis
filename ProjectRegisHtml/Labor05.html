<p>The Augean stables were the home of 3,000 cattle with <em>poisoned faeces</em> which Augeas had been given by his father <b>Helios</b>, god of the sun.</p> 
<p>Heracles was given the near impossible task of cleaning the stables of the diseased faeces. King Augeas bet him twenty cows to one that he could not clean the stables in a day. He accomplished it by borrowing a mattock and digging ditches on both sides of the stables, moving them into the ditches, and then diverting the rivers Alpheios and Pineios to wash the ditches clean within an hour.</p>
