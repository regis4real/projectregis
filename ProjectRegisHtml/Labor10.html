<p>The next challenge was to capture the herd guarded by a <em>two-headed</em> dog called Orthrus, which belonged to Geryon; a giant with three heads and six arms who lived in Erytheia.</p>
	<p>While travelling to Erytheia, he passed through the Libyan desert and was so annoyed by the heat he shot an arrow at Helios, the sun. Helios, impressed, lent him his giant cup which Heracles used to find Orthrus, the herdsman Erytion and the owner, Geryon. </p>
		<p>He killed the first two with his club and the third with a poisoned arrow shot through the three heads. </p>
		<p>Heracles then herded the cattle and had difficulty moving them, because Hera sent her gadflies to sting them in their private parts, which made them go berserk and scatter. He rounded them up amd continued before he realized he was 500 miles off. There he met an ugly snake-tailed woman who promised to round them up on the condition that he kisses her three times.</p>
		<p> He did so and kissed her, although begrudgingly, and so the woman wrapped them up.
		With all these done, he took them to Eurystheus.</p>
