<p><b>Hippolyta</b> was an <em>Amazon</em> queen and she had a <em>girdle</em> given to her by her father <b>Ares</b>, the god of war. Heracles had to retrieve the girdle and return it to Eurystheus.</p> 
<p>He and his band of companions received a rough welcome because, ordered by Hera, the Amazons were supposed to attack them; however, against all odds, Heracles completed the task and secured the girdle for Eurystheus.</p>
