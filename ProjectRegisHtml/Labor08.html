<p>Stealing the horses from Diomedes' stables that had been trained by their owner to feed on <em>human flesh</em> was his next challenge.</p>
<p>Heracles' task was to capture them and hand them over to Eurystheus. He accomplished this task by feeding King Diomedes to the animals before binding their mouths shut.</p>
