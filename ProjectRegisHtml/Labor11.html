	<p>These sacred fruits were protected by Hera who had set <b>Ladon</b>, a fearsome, hundred-headed, unsleeping dragon as the guardian of the tree on which the apples grew.</p> 
<p>Heracles had to first find where the garden was; he asked Nereus for help. He came across the titan Prometheus on his journey, who was chained to a rock where an eagle ate away at his liver. This was a punishment set on him by Zeus for stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to mankind.</p>
<p> Heracles shot the eagle eating at his liver, and in return he helped Heracles with knowledge that his brother Atlas would know where the garden was. He also told Heracles that no mortal could touch the apples, as they would drop dead, and so advised him to persuade Atlas, who as a titan was immortal, to pluck the apples for him. </p> 
<p>Heracles sailed on to Tangier, Morocco where the titan Atlas held the heavens. Atlas, who was also the father of the Hesperides, offered to help him with the apples if he would hold up the heavens while he was gone. Heracles shot the dragon Ladon over the garden walls in its heart using one of the arrows dipped in the hydra's blood. Atlas greeted his daughters the Hesperides, plucked some of the apples and went off.</p>
<p>When Atlas returned, he tried to persuade Heracles to hold the heavens for longer while he goes to help Heracles deliver the apples to Eurystheus with his long legs, but Heracles knew that Atlas would go off and free the other titans and then start a rebellion against Olympus, so he told Atlas to hold the heavens while he adjusts his lion skin cloak to make a comfortable support pillow. As Atlas put down the apples to hold the heavens, Heracles wrapped the apples in his lion skin cloak and took off, making Atlas take the burden of the heavens once again, and returned the apples to Mycenae.</p>
