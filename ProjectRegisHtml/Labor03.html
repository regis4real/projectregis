  <p>Not to kill, but to catch, this hind that was sacred to <b>Artemis</b>; the goddess of the moon and wild hunting. A different, but still difficult, task.</p> 
  <p>It cost time, but, having chased it for a year, Heracles caught the hind by shooting it between the <em>sinew</em> and <em>bone</em> of its forelegs without a drop of blood. Artemis intervened, but as soon as Heracles explained the situation to her, she allowed him to take it, and was more impressed at his skill in archery.</p>
<p>Heracles bound the hind, took it and presented it alive to Eurystheus.</p>
