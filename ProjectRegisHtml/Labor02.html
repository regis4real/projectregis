<p>A <em>fire-breathing</em> monster with multiple serpent heads. When one head was cut off, two would grow in its place.</p>
 <p>It lived under a tree in a swamp near Lerna. Hera had sent it in hopes it would destroy Heracles' home city because she thought it was invincible. While Heracles battled the chthonic creature, his nephew Iolaus handed him a torch which he used to singe the neck stumps of the heads he cut.</p> 
 <p>That was how he defeated the monster and dipped his arrows in its poisoned blood, thus <em>envenomizing</em> them and making them so lethal that a single scratch from the arrows would give the victim an <em>extremely</em> painful death.</p>
