<p>The harmful bull, father of the <b>Minotaur</b> (half man, half bull), was laying waste to the lands round Knossos on Crete. It embodied the rage of <b>Poseidon</b>, god of the seas, at having his gift (the Bull) to Minos diverted from the intention to sacrifice it to himself.</p>
<p> Heracles tracked it to a tree, then tussled with it until he was able to clip a ring through its nose and capture it. Then he carried it on his shoulders to Eurystheus in Tiryns.</p> 
	<p>Eurystheus saw he bull and got terrified and demanded that it be released, where it wandered to Marathon which it then terrorized, until killed by Theseus.</p>
